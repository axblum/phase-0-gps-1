# What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * Some of the innerworkings of GitHub were explained
# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * How to make github not ask for one's username/password everytime
# What still confuses you about git?
  * I think I have a pretty clear understanding of git.
# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * My first pairing was a lot of fun, I tried to keep it not to serious. But it was also helpful to see someone else work on the same problem as me. Allowing us to talk things over.
